# Collision Detector
Interesting short code challenges to detect collisions

### Brief Introduction
This repository will contain several puzzles and challenges that I have attempted and found interesting over the course of my undergraduate career. I will keep it updated with new ones as I try them and find solutions. Each puzzle that I post will have a try it yourself code template that sets up the challenge for you and a second piece of code that contains my solution to it. If you come up a more elegant or simpler solution, I'd love to hear about it. Create a pull request with your new solution for review and it can be added to the set of solutions for a given problem. Each puzzle will have its own readme with instructions on getting started. 

### Adding New Puzzles
If you have come up with a new puzzle that you would like featured here, please create a pull request and add it with the same formatting as all the other puzzles. Create a readme within your puzzle file that appropriately provides instructions on how to start and any other relevant help that may be required.
